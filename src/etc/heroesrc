## This is a system-wide heroes configuration file
## (read before any user's configuration)
##

## Try to get sound-track filenames from these places.
## Keep hqmod last so they override the standard modules.
soundconf: $(data-dir)/mod/sound.conf
soundconf: $(data-dir)/hqmod/sound.conf

## Uncomment the following lines if you want to share a global score
## file, or global game saves.  The path must exists, Heroes is not
## smart enough to create missing directories.  You will probably also
## want to create the file yourself in order to set the file's
## permissions and/or ownership, and maybe given some
## additional permissions to the heroes binary.
## The `ifdef/endif' construct here means the global files will
## only be used if the binary is either SUID or SGID.
#ifdef suid-or-sgid
#setrsc: score-file $(sys-dir)/scores
#setrsc: saved-games-file $(sys-dir)/savedgames
#endif

## $(sys-dir) defaults to /var/games/heroes, is this what you want?
#setrsc: sys-dir /another/path/heroes

## By default, if Heroes has a sgid-bit or suid-bit, it will drop
## all privileges once the score and saved games are open.  This
## happens before the user configuration is read, and therefore before
## the display and sound are initialized.
##
## Sometime you do not want these privileges to be dropped because
## your setup requires them.  For instance your display driver might
## require read/write access to /dev/mem, or a similar requirement may
## exist for the sound library).
##
## The commands below allow Heroes to keep the s-bit privileges for
## its whole life.
#keepsuid: yes
#keepsgid: yes
