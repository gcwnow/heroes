Seems my mail from home has not come through... I built a complete set of
(debian) heroes packages on m68k, no problem. However it does not run, I got
a variety of segfaults. I will resent the mail, there were some error codes,
maybe somebody can make use of that. The fun thing, every time I started
heroes, I got a different error message...

Hmm, a mixture of 1.1.2 and 1.0.[1 or 8] I think. I am not exactly sure
which is used for the package, will check again, was late last night...

>  - is a window mapped before the crash or not?
window mapped? If you mean opened, yes a small window is opened, like with
i386, drawn with a black background, maybe a little white.
>  - how is configured you X server (resolution, depth)?
m68k uses xserver-fbdev, with my grafics board it is not yet possible to
change the resolution. so now its using 1024x768 in 8 bit. But also when I
run heroes via ssh from my i386 machine (32bit) it crashes (did no ttest
last night though).

Sure. I would think all the SDL games I maintain are working on m68k.
Actually I did not test them all, but I am pretty sure at least gemdropx
works, see here for the links:

Ok, good news. Tried that, its very slow, but it seems to work much better.
I remember seeing on the list the -S option, when I use that (with the
non-debug version) heroes runs much better. Actually it runs very good, so
its only a sound problem. It runs so good, the gameplay is much too fast, I
thought it would be much too slow... maybe there is a problem with
calculating game/machine speed? Do you use bogomips for that? My Amiga has
around 100 Bogomips, but the speed compares to a 486/100, maybe Pentium90,
with a clock frequency of 50MHz.
So there is another problem, but not as bad, as I first thought.

Can try that.

The vehicles are running much too fast, the camera could follow (most of the
time) which I find very astonishing for such an old machine.

Didnt work, but I did not spend much time on it. I think the debian
maintainer should update the package to support other arches as well, maybe I
did something wrong while building the package. I couldn't build a complete
package, since on m68k I can only build for sdl, not for ggi. Thats one
thing I was not able to get into the debian files, but thats Daniel's jobs,
isn't it? ;-)

With 0.6 I get the right speed. So its working pretty well (besides the
sound problem) on m68k. Maybe a note in the readme (Daniel: its working for
me on m68k only with -S) but otherwise its fine for non-i386 I think.

hello I've compiled heroes recently on my linux system.  everything
runs fine, but I do have a problem with the controls. I mean, that the
reaction of the vehicle is too slow (it turns too slow) .  This
shouldn't depend on my machine configuration (350 mhz k6-2 128 MB
RAM).

Version: 0.6

I've compiled it with SDL. I have a SUSE linux 6.4 distribution (with
a "few" changes (ie: newer ver. of make a few newer and updated
libs...))

by too slow I mean that the vehicle doesn't turn at that moment when I
press the key. This delay is not long enough to be mesureable, but it
disturbs, so that the gameplay isn't fluent enough...

Just a notice to say I have seen what you describe on a laptop
running FreeBSD, a couple of week ago.  And no, that's not
the *standard* behaviour as I answered you :).

Still I have no idea what the reason is.  (For the records that
was an Heroes 0.8, compiled against SDL too; I don't even know
if GGI works on FreeBSD.)
