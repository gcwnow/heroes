I am pleased to announce the release of Heroes 0.21

Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but
includes many graphical improvements and new game features.
In it, you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect
powerups while avoiding obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even
your own trail.

There are five game modes available.  Quest is the classical
Nibbles, in Death Match you start with very long tails a must kill your
opponents, in Kill'em All you must run over lemmings moving on the
ground, in Time Cash or Color modes you must collect money or pyramids
of color.  Heroes features 12 original sound tracks, 94 levels (in 10
different tile sets) plus a level editor.

This is a bug fix release.  See NEWS for details.

This version requires at least Heroes-data-1.4.

HELP!  Heroes development is open to anyone and we welcome any
contribution.  In the hypothetical case you would like to spend some
time on the source code and don't know what to do, please, ask the
mailing list: there is presently some (non-boring) tasks that needs to
be done and for which understanding the full source tree is not a
prerequisite.
