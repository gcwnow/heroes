Some files in this directory come from external packages.  Read the
file HACKING in the top level directory for a list of them.

These files are used by a program called aclocal (part of the GNU automake
package).  aclocal uses these files to create aclocal.m4 which is in turn
used by autoconf to create the configure script at the the top level in
this distribution.

The files starting with `h-' are meant to be specific to Heroes
(precisely, they are just parts of configure.in moved here to to ease
the reading of configure.in).

The Makefile.am file in this directory is automatically generated
by tools/genm4mam.sh.
